    I highly recommend Soham Biswas, who contributed to the 
    **Next Generation Alarm and Event Screen** project at CERN. I had the pleasure of working
    with him as his supervisor. Soham excelled in developing components using **C++** and 
    the **Qt** framework, ensuring efficient, maintainable code. He also optimized our CI/CD
    processes through Gitlab Pipelines, significantly improving our workflow.<br/><br/>
    Additionally, his expertise with the SCADA system **Siemens WinCC OA** was crucial in integrating 
    our project with the existing infrastructure. Soham's technical skills, dedication, and teamwork 
    make him a valuable asset to any organization. I strongly endorse him for any engineering role.<br/><br/>
    I am confident that Soham will be a valuable asset to any organisation he chooses to join.
    I strongly recommend him for any position that requires a skilled, motivated and reliable engineer.

    It is my pleasure to recommend Soham Biswas for a
    position within your Organisation. Soham was employed
    in our Group as a Software Developer. I had the
    opportunity to work with Soham as his mentor within
    the section as well as the lead of the project he
    worked on. During that period, he showed himself to be
    a versatile and smart developer.<br/><br/>
    Soham was hired to work on the "**FESA Navigator**", a complex graphical application that is an
    essential tool to develop, test and diagnose equipment
    throughout CERN's accelerator complex. As part of part
    of his work on the GUI application, Soham proved able
    to implement complex graphical elements (e.g
    feature-full plotting widgets with bidirectional data
    binding), but also handle challenging technical issues
    such as maintaining good UI responsiveness under high
    data volumnes/rates.<br/><br/>
    I have really enjoyed working with Soham, and highly
    recommend him to any future employer.

    It is my pleasure and honour to recommend Soham Biswas
    as a Software Developer for your Organisation. I was
    his University Professor and have known him for over
    three years now. I was delighted to supervise his
    activities at IEM Innovation lab and Entrepreneurship
    Development Cell.<br /><br/>
    He is exceptionally skilled in **Python** and is well
    known for his Programming and Robotics projects. He
    has been a member of our esteemed R&D lab, namely IEDC
    since his freshman year and has been contributing to
    various technical projects for the same. He possesses
    knowledge about other computer science domains as
    well. <br /><br/>
    I feel certain that you will be just as impressed with
    Soham as I am. As an educator who is committed to
    helping deserving students succeed, I strongly
    encourage you to consider Soham for a role in your
    Organisation.
