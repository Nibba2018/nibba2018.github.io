    - I am currently working as a **Software Engineer** under the
      **Industrial Control Systems** group of the
      **BEAMS** department at
      [CERN](https://home.cern/).
    - I play a pivotal role in developing and maintaining the Alarms and Events screen, a critical 
      component of CERN's accelerator control system. I carefully consider the system's performance 
      requirements and incorporate valuable physicist/operator feedback to ensure an optimal user Interface and Experience.
    - Leveraging my expertise in software engineering, I skillfully utilize the WinCC OA SCADA system framework to 
      establish seamless interaction between the Alarms and Events screen and the Controls system. To accomplish this, 
      I employ the Qt framework to create visually appealing graphical user interface elements while harnessing the power of C++ to facilitate the high-speed processing of enormous amounts of data.

    - Technologies that I worked on: C++, Qt, WinCC OA, Python, CI/CD.

    - As a golang developer, I spearheaded a transformative project focused on implementing a highly
      efficient backend API service. My role entailed handling complex blockchain transactions while 
      prioritizing distributed computing practices to achieve optimal performance. The seamless flow 
      of data from the user interface to the backend and back was carefully orchestrated, ensuring a 
      smooth and responsive user experience. <b>RabbitMQ</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b> were utilized 
      to implement message queues and database operations respectively.

    - Technologies that I worked on: Golang, RabbitMQ, Docker, PostgreSQL.

    - I worked as a **Software Engineer** under the
      **Controls Software and Services** group of the
      **BEAMS** department at [CERN](https://home.cern/).
    - I developed a complex graphical application tool to develop, test, and diagnose equipment
      throughout CERN's accelerator complex in python with the Qt framework by successfully
      delivering fundamental pieces of the application such as feature-full plotting widgets
      with bi-directional data binding, maintaining good UI responsiveness under high data
      volumes/rates and integrating technical and functional constraints into the software to provide
      rich user experience. This project enabled the physicists and operators at CERN with a user
      friendly graphical application which helped improve their efficiency compared to working with
      complicated command line tools.

    - Technologies that I worked on: Python, PyQt, pyqtgraph,
      pytest-qt, Numpy.

    - **Sub-org:** [FURY](https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/)
    - As a python developer, I worked on an open source python graphics library
      [FURY](https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/) where I developed optimized Virtual Reality ready 2D and 3D graphical user interfaces from
      scratch via graphics primitives and provided physics engine integration with pyBullet. More
      information regarding my weekly progress can be found at the official (Python Software Foundation blogs)[https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/nibba2018s-blog/].
      My work benefited the organisation with additional UI components and a fully documented
      physics engine integration.

    - **Project:** *Personalized Summary Tool*.
    - As a Research software engineer intern, I developed a complex graphical application to generate
      Personalised Summaries of crowd-sourced articles to end-users by implementing Eye Gaze
      Tracking, the graphical user interface and the complete flow and integrity of the application.
      This work allowed the end users to generate their own personalised summary of the content being
      browsed during their current session.
